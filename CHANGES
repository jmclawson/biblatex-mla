  package option to revert
- added Italian localization (from Andrea Marchitelli)

- preliminary conversion of documentation to Philipp Lehman's ltxdockit, as 
  previous documentation files were lost

Changelog for version 0.9:
- many changes for compatibility with Biblatex v.0.9
- introduced support for style from latest MLA edition (this was a major 
  undertaking)
- new "print", "web", and "generaleditor" bibstrings
- formatting for eprint sources from JSTOR and Google Books, as already

Changelog for version 0.8.1:
- did nothing but make 0.8 beta final to upgrade CTAN

Changelog for version 0.8 beta:
- added further examples from the MLA Handbook (6th edition). Almost all of
  the non-periodical examples in section 5.6.x (and many of the periodical
  examples in 5.7.x) contained therein can now be successfully re-created
  using biblatex-mla.
- nameaddon and authortype behavior standardized across entrytypes
- added bookauthor support for suppcollection and suppbook
- significantly improved handling of multivolume works
- further improved handling of "et al." There should now be a comma before 
  "et al." only in reversed (last-first) naming schemes. Standard (first-last)
  schemes and last-name only schemes will omit the comma.
- improved support for maintitle
- improved presentation of title in conference proceeding, where title ends in
  an abbreviation dot
- added preliminary support for "generaleditor" editortype in the language
  (lbx) files
- added preliminary support for "volstodate" string in the language (lbx)
  files, theoretically to be used when indicating total volume numbers of
  multi-volume works with open-ranged years
- added title format for reference books
- removed extra leading space before nameaddon brackets
- added support for formatting of open-ranged years (as suggested by 
  Philipp Lehman)
- added support for limiting remote info, using methods similar to
  biblatex-apa
- added totalnames support for translator field
- re-added hyperref support mistakenly disabled in version 0.7
- fixed many citereset problems (while potentially introducing others...)
- many citation macros tidied and future-proofed
- footnote presentation considerably more stable

Changelog for version 0.7 final:
- added examples from the MLA Handbook (6th edition)
- added support for origlocation, origpublisher, origtitle, and origlanguage
  to allow for reprints and translations. Biblatex-mla only uses the
  origlanguage field to trigger the use of \bibstring{transof} in place of
  \bibstring{reprintof} for reprinted articles and will not actually print the
  contents of the origlanguage field.
- re-added support for translators in articles (mistakenly lost in 0.6)
- added localization and bibstrings for "bytypecompilerandeditor" and
  "transof" (in addition to "typecompilerandeditor")
- significantly improved footnote support, bringing it inline with support for
  entries in the bibliography. This work is currently in progress, but non-
  periodical entries should be fully supported.
- in addition to Spanish and Portuguese localizations (contributed by Ivan
  Fernandez and Paulo Ferreira, respectively) and existing American
  localizations, version 0.7 is also compatible with non-American English
  dialects for localized punctuation patterns. In your preamble, call Babel
  with the language of your choice: british, canadian, australian, spanish,
  and american should all work equally well (though some newer bibstrings
  remain untranslated in Spanish). Portuguese support is not yet included with
  biblatex.

Changelog for version 0.7 beta:
- added partial support for @suppbook, @suppcollection
- made style definitions independent from sample Biblatex style files
- segregated localizations into external .lbx files
- added comma before name affixes
- added test for comma before "et al.": negative in citations, positive in
  list of Works Cited
- added test for colon before subtitle, returning negative after terminal
  punctuation (such as exclamation point, question mark)
- added "totalnames" entry option for listing all authors and editors in the
  list of Works Cited for a particular entry
- added "uniquetranslator" entry option, used for an @incollection entry with
  its own translator not shared with the rest of the collection
- slightly changed default name dash in Works Cited
- added support for year editions for @inreference works
- improved logic of @video macro
- added support for "eds." before title when editors are plural
- renamed "strict" package option to "footnoterulestrict"
- added draft mode style helper for multiple citations
- added "mladraft" package option for calling style helper outside of draft
  mode
- added localization for "typecompilerandeditor" editortype

Changelog for version 0.6.1:
- IMPORTANT CHANGE: because of difficulties formatting articles without volume
  numbers as newspaper articles, I've had to regress that option sooner than I
  expected. Updated bibtex files by adding the entrysubtype field and setting
  it to "newspaper" or "magazine". Article entries with undefined volume
  fields are now formatted as journal articles without any volume numbers (as
  one might have expected biblatex-mla to have done all along...)
- updated documentation for the above change; added link for installing
  Biblatex from CTAN in installation instructions
- fixed bugs with spacing, problems with spurious punctuation in Reviews, and
  some other minor things
- updated footnote internal macros to use native quotation marks and
  punctuation nesting, thereby fully regressing mkbibquotepunct command
- added "strict" package option after biblatex-chicago-notes-df; feature is
  undocumented for now

Changelog for version 0.6:
- native support for biblatex-, csquote-, and babel-empowered American-style
  punctuation and double quotation marks added in biblatex 0.8 (footnotes not
  yet updated)
- add support for @unpublished, @proceedings, @inproceedings, @periodical
  entrytypes
- add support for published theses
- standardized .bib file keys, strings, fields across entrytypes
- improve minor presentation errors, including misplaced comma before "et al,"
  the size of the name dash in Works Cited (to match that in the Style Manual
  more closely (redefine \mlanamedash to change)), and other things
- simplified and made many internal macros less hack-y and more localizable
- defined many new bibliography strings and redefined existing ones
- commented out issn, isbn, doi, and similar fields as a temporary fix
- allow idem after shorthands in citations
- improved presentation of dates, dropping opening zero
- added support for articles in special issues of journals
- added support for annotated bibliographies using the "annotation" option
- improved support/presentation for subtitles
- usetranslator entry-option now stable, uses native biblatex support
- improved documentation
- add support for nameaddon

Changelog for version 0.5 (final):
- introduction of firstlonghand and nofullnote package options
- changed approach of shorthand citations, defaulting to a "longhand" citation
  for the first citation
- introduction of usetranslator entry option
- fixed more stupid errors
- added support for video and booklet entrytypes
- added hyperlinks for citations with only page numbers
- added better support for useauthor and useeditor entry options
- added location to newspaper articles
- added edition ("version") to newspaper articles (ie, late, national,
  morning, etc.)
- added Spanish localization by Ivan Fernandez

Changelog for version 0.5 (beta):
- introduction of MLA-style footnote citation support
- fixed many more stupid errors (made since the beginning)
- added support for book reviews and reference articles (use "review"
  entrytype and "inreference" entrytype, respectively)
- tidied stylistic problems including erroneous punctuation before URLs
  (pointed out by Stephen Brumbaugh), stray spaces, a few doubled
  punctuations, etc.
- added support for anonymous incollection works (for example, "Beowulf" in an
  English literature anthology shouldn't by default be referenced by the
  editor of that anthology)
- added support for single-author collections (for example, a single poet's
  Collected Poems, with or without a named editor)
- preliminary support for "video" entrytype
- a few other things I'm forgetting

Changelog for version 0.4:
- proper MLA-style crossref support (though Philipp Lehmann's warnings of the
  dangers of crossrefs in Bibtex files still hold: the parent will overwrite
  anything undefined in the child, like Title and Author)
- fixed many stupid errors (made when converting to biblatex 0.7 in version
  0.3)
- introduced logic for idems, ibids, and prenotes (reduces chances of prenotes
  and ibids obscuring the actual author's name)
- changed style name to biblatex-mla to fit in with everything else being
  lowercase
- fixed compatibility with tex4ht (documents made with biblatex-mla can now be
  converted to OpenOffice format easily)
- added support for Newspaper articles (use "article" type, set no volume and
  no issue number)
- added access dates for online articles
- got rid of a couple stray periods lurking in some places.
- defined \fullcite command to provide examples of bibliographic citations (as
  seen in the new samples page)
- added samples page

Changelog for version 0.3:
- updated for compatibility to biblatex 0.7
- incorporated improvements made by Jay Savage regarding URL presentation in
  Works Cited and the handling of edited books lacking authors
- added support for the starred variants of \cite* and \autocite* for citing
  titles when the author is already named in the sentence (e.g., "Joyce says
  many fine things (Ulysses 34)," written as "Joyce says many fine things
  \autocite*[34]{citekey}"). This variation will basically just force skip the
  author's name in a citation. If it's an author with multiple titles in the
  Works Cited, it will list the title and page; otherwise it will list just
  the page.
- added functionality to use first name initials to differentiate among common
  surnames (option uniquename=init made available in biblatex 0.7) in
  citations
- added localizations for "Ed. and trans.," etc. I'm not sure how accurate
  these are yet, but it at least lets us have nicer Works Cited lists. You'll
  see this change when works have a single person responsible for any
  combination of editing, translating, introducing, annotating, or providing
  commentary, forewards, or afterwards. With this change, the person is listed
  only once, with the appropriate words before the name.
- restyled the URL font in the Works Cited to be the same as the rest of the
  documents (as suggested by Jay Savage)
- added support for \cite (same as \autocite) to be more supportive to
  existing programs that assume cite as the command used for references and to
  make conversion easier for newcomers who've already been using \cite
- improved idem handling with boolean triggers
- cleaned up macro names to make them easier to follow
